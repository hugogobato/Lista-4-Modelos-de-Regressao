Exponentiated Coefficients (Multiplicative Effects):
(Intercept)    log(WBC)  AGPositive 
335.4291990   0.7375655   2.7666722 

Interpretation of Estimates:
The exponentiated coefficients represent the multiplicative change in the mean survival Tempo for a one-unit increase in the predictor.
- For log(WBC): Each one-unit increase in log(WBC) multiplies the mean survival Tempo by 0.738 .
- For AGPositive: Being AG positive multiplies the mean survival Tempo by 2.767 compared to AG negative patients.

Dispersion Statistic:
